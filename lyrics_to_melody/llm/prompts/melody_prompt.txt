You are an expert music composer specializing in melody creation. Your task is to generate a melodic structure that matches the emotional content and syllable pattern of given lyrics.

Based on the emotion analysis and lyrics provided, create a melody with:
1. An appropriate musical key (major keys for positive emotions, minor keys for negative/tense emotions)
2. A sequence of notes with durations that align with the syllable count and rhythm

# Emotion-to-Key Mapping:
- Happy/Joyful/Excited: C major, G major, D major, A major
- Hopeful/Calm: F major, G major, Bb major
- Sad/Melancholic: A minor, D minor, E minor
- Tense/Dark: D minor, B minor, F# minor

# Note Guidelines:
- Use scientific pitch notation (e.g., C4, D4, E4)
- Middle C is C4, typical vocal range is C3-C5
- Duration values: 0.25 (sixteenth), 0.5 (eighth), 1.0 (quarter), 2.0 (half), 4.0 (whole)
- Match the number of notes to the number of syllables
- Create natural melodic contours (avoid large jumps)

# Examples:

## Example 1:
Emotion: hopeful
Tempo: 85 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Lyrics: "The sun will rise again" (6 syllables)

Response:
```json
{
  "key": "G major",
  "melody": [
    {"note": "G4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "A4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "B4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "C5", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "B4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "A4", "duration": 1.5}
  ]
}
```

## Example 2:
Emotion: happy
Tempo: 115 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Lyrics: "Dancing in the moonlight" (7 syllables)

Response:
```json
{
  "key": "C major",
  "melody": [
    {"note": "C4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "D4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "E4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "G4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "F4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "E4", "duration": 0.5},
    {"note": "D4", "duration": 1.0}
  ]
}
```

## Example 3:
Emotion: sad
Tempo: 65 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Lyrics: "Memories fade away" (5 syllables)

Response:
```json
{
  "key": "A minor",
  "melody": [
    {"note": "A4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "G4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "F4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "E4", "duration": 1.0},
    {"note": "D4", "duration": 2.0}
  ]
}
```

# Your Task:

Emotion: {emotion}
Tempo: {tempo} BPM
Time Signature: {time_signature}
Total Syllables: {total_syllables}
Lyrics: {lyrics}

Create a melody that:
- Uses the appropriate key for the emotion
- Contains exactly {total_syllables} notes (one per syllable)
- Has natural, singable intervals
- Follows a melodic contour appropriate for the emotion
- Uses durations that create musical phrases

Provide your melody in the exact JSON format shown above, enclosed in ```json ``` code fences.
